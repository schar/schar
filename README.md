### Hello 👋

My name is Simon Charlow. I'm an Associate Professor in the [Yale Department
of Linguistics](https://ling.yale.edu).

I'm working on computational tools for doing natural language semantics. I use
type theory, functional programming (Haskell and OCaml), and occasionally
logic programming (Prolog) to develop models of how complex linguistic
expressions come to have the meaning (or, often, meanings) they do, given the
meanings of their parts.

Aside from the code here, I have [some gists](https://gist.github.com/schar).
My contact info is on [my website](https://simoncharlow.com). Feel free to get
in touch.
