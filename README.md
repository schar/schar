### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Simon Charlow. I'm an Associate Professor in the [Yale
Department of Linguistics](https://ling.yale.edu).

I'm working on computational tools for doing natural language semantics. I use
type theory, functional programming (Haskell and OCaml), and occasionally logic programming (Prolog)
to develop models of how complex linguistic expressions come to have the
meaning (or, often, meanings) they do, given the meanings of their parts.
I'm interested in...

- Using monads and applicative functors to structure theories of meaning
- Parsing and/as type inference, and combinatory categorial grammar
- State and nondeterminism, scope and continuations
- Ambiguity, under-specification, and anaphora resolution
- Dynamic theories of semantics, and of discourse
- NLP, distributional models of meaning, and their role in compositional
  semantics

Aside from the code here, I have [some gists](https://gist.github.com/schar).
My contact info is on [my website](https://simoncharlow.com). Feel free to get
in touch.
