### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Simon Charlow. I'm an Associate Professor in the [Rutgers
Department of Linguistics](https://ling.rutgers.edu), where I also serve as
the Graduate Program Director.

I'm working on computational tools for doing natural language semantics. I use
type theory and functional programming (now usually Haskell, previously OCaml)
to develop models of how complex linguistic expressions come to have the
meaning (or, often, meanings) they do, given the meanings of their parts. I'm
interested in monads and applicative functors, parsing and type inference,
state and nondeterminism, scope and continuations, ambiguity,
under-specification, and anaphora resolution, and dynamic theories of
semantics, and of discourse. Aside from the code here, I have [some
gists](https://gist.github.com/schar).

My contact info is on [my website](https://simoncharlow.com). Feel free to get
in touch.
